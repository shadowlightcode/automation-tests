# Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. 
# However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 
# inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. 
# Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. 
# In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). 
# Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().

# no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) â†’ 3
# no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) â†’ 3
